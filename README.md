# Twitter Sentiment Analysis

This project focuses on performing sentiment analysis on a dataset of Twitter tweets using natural language processing (NLP) techniques. The goal is to classify tweets as positive, negative, or neutral based on their content. 

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project was obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kazanova/sentiment140/data). The dataset contains the following columns:
* target: Sentiment of the tweet (0 = negative, 4 = positive, 2 = neutral)
* ids: The ID of the tweet
* date: The date the tweet was posted
* user: The user who tweeted
* text: The text content of the tweet

### Project Objectives:
The key objective of this project are:
1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyze the dataset to gain insights, clean the data, and perform visualizations.
2. Preprocessing: Perform text cleaning (e.g., removing special characters, stopwords, etc.) to prepare the tweets for sentiment analysis.
